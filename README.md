# CMS Jupyter materials English
This repository contains material for classroom activities using open data from CMS CERN. <br>
Materials provide both basic introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks as well as ready exercises for the classrooms.

## Contents
- Introduction to Jupyter <br>
  - This folder contains the very basics of Python programming and useful commands for creating and formatting Notebooks in Jupyter. If you prefer to run things from your own device, installation information can also be found from here.
- Exercises with Open data
  - This folder contains several exercises to be carried out using Jupyter.
- Data
  - Here you can find all the data used in the Notebooks and also a few extra files in csv-format.
  - These files (with a slightly different naming) can also be found in [this record](http://opendata.web.cern.ch/record/545) on the CERN Open Data Portal or with [this search](http://opendata.web.cern.ch/search?page=1&size=20&q=&subtype=Derived&type=Dataset&experiment=CMS&file_type=csv).

## Using the materials
The hands-down easiest way is to use the entirely browser-based [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org), which builds a temporal, virtual workspace for you. This way you can avoid any installations or lengthy setups and get straight to work. You can even simplify that process to simple, clickable buttons like these:

|Notebook|Open|
|:--|:--|
|Welcome to Jupyter!|[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/cms-opendata-education/cms-jupyter-materials-english/master?filepath=Introduction-to-jupyter/Welcome-to-Jupyter-Notebooks-intro.ipynb)|

MyBinder works 99% of the time without problems, but it is still in beta and can sometimes be under active development. One alternative is to use Google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but that does require a google account log-in.

If you prefer to use the files locally from your own computer, you can download the contents of this repository as a ZIP which you can extract to your own device. The easiest way is to download the whole repository by clicking *Clone or download* button at the front page. <br>
